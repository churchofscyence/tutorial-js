# How to launch jupyter notebook from a terminal

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to open IPYNB notebooks in the location you prefer. I generally recommend the following:     

* First create a folder at your preferred destination      
* Then go to terminal/cmd prompt and navigate to your above made destination      
* Once in the destination then type in **jupyter notebook**     

This will then automatically trigger the browser and open the Home tab, you can start a new notebook with your preferred kernel, rename and save the notebook, which it saves at the location where you navigated through the terminal
